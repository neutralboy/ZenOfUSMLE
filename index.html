        <p>Xponential Advantage is all about teaching you test-taking skills. We believe after 100s of hours of tutoring students for the USMLE that the most significant deficiency in students preparing for the USMLE is not knowledge or intelligence; it is test-taking skills. Imagine if they invited you to the top chef, and you learnt all the recipes by heart, but you didn’t know how to cook those dishes. That’s how most students prepare for the USMLE. They have bookish knowledge and no idea how to apply it. There was no course in the world that taught test-taking skills, so we made the perfect one. Get ready to become a USMLE Question Solving Master.</p>
