        <p>Xponential Advantage is all about teaching you test-taking skills. We believe after 100s of hours of tutoring students for USMLE that the biggest deficiency in most students preparing for USMLE is not knowledge or intelligence, it is test-taking skills. Imagine if you were invited to top chef and you learnt all the recipes by heart, but you didn't know how to cook those dishes. That's how most students prepare for the USMLE. They have bookish knowledge, but they no idea how to apply it properly. There is no course in the world right now that offers to teach you test-taking skills.</p>
